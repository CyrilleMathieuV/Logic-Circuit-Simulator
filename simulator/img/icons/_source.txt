All icons from: https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Rounded

Fill: 1 (rightmost)
Weight: 400 (middle value)

Downloaded as svg and run through svgo with the sibling config:

$ svgo --config=_svgo.config.js *.icon.svg

(Also see comments in config.)

Careful: these settings work well with the downloaded glyphs from Google font, but manual work my be needed to strip additional useless SVG markup when editing files manually.
